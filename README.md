I use two linked lists, one sequence, one stack to complete it.<br><br>
The two linked lists are representing two windows of customers. The queue stores the people who are waiting. The stack stores the people who are completed the service, it will output when the program ends.<br><br>
This program represent the peak of my ability, cause I just learned stack and sequence at that time, so it is not easy for me to control three kinds of data structure. I am really proud of myself, and this program give my teacher a deep impression.
